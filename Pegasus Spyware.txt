Description: In June 2017, the Mexican government, led by President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, acknowledged the acquisition of Pegasus, a sophisticated spyware developed by the NSO Group. This software is designed to be installed on devices when victims click on a link sent via SMS. Once installed, it allows attackers to access sensitive information such as photos, messages, and contacts, and even activate the device's microphone and camera without the user's knowledge. The NSO Group claims that Pegasus is intended for use against terrorists and criminals, but reports indicate it has been misused against journalists, activists, and political opponents, raising serious ethical concerns about surveillance and privacy violations.
